    <h1><b>What we do?</b></h1><br>
    <p style="color:rgb(71, 171, 199)">“The era of search is over, and we have won the data war. Our personal data
        belongs to us and to us alone, and we
        get paid to share it. This has created a sustainable and symbiotic relationship between the outside world and
        our needs and wants. As a result, the world has become optimally efficient; where customers save money,
        businesses are profitable, communities have displaced monopolies and duopolies, and the societies have
        benefitted from the advancement of science and technologies.”</p><br>
    <p>This is the vision of ECGiT for the future of transactional business, and we have been building it since 2012.
        ECGiT provides a global System platform with built-in support for system Integration.</p><br>
    <p>We laid the foundation at ECGiT with a vision to overturn the status quo in the Technical value chain: where
        stakeholders engage with their customers in a direct, meaningful and effective manner and take a well-informed
        decision to run their business. Our technical startup space is brimming with great ideas, many of which have the
        potential to be highly disruptive and innovative.</p><br>

        IoT, Big data and blockchain to help retail value chain stakeholders, and their customers.Our ambition to make
        this vision a reality is matched by our domain expertise, ability and experience.</p><br>
